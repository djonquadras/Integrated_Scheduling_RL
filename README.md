# About

This repository contains my master project developed at the Laboratory for Productive and Logistic Intelligent Systems (ProLogIS) at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). This is part of the Metamaintain project, between ProLogIS and Bremer Institute for Production and Logistics (BIBA) at University of Bremen.

The aim of this project is to propose a model for the integrated production and maintenance scheduling to manufacturing systems applying a **Reinforcement Learning** approach.
